To train our model for cell counting we have used a dataset obtained from the Kaggle learning platform which can be accessed from the following link: "https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018" or from the folder in this repository called "CSV for training".

For image training we have used the images obtained by the microscope in which different zooms are used and whether or not the solution has the trypan blue solution.
