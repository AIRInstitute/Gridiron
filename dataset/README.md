This document describes one (1)  scenarios that can be simulated/emulated using the only one (1) dataset. 

The scenario described in this paper consists of training a model for counting live and dead cells to be seen under a microscope before and after the addition of Trypan Blue solution.

#Scenario:
To train our model for cell counting we have used a dataset obtained from the Kaggle learning platform which can be accessed from the following link: "https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018" or from the folder in this repository called "CSV for training".

In order to check that the above model works correctly, we have used the images obtained by the microscope in which different zooms of the camera are used. In addition, a difference is made between whether the image shown has the trypan blue solution and can be accessed by entering the folder contained in this repository called "Microscope images".
